Hip-Publisher
=============

## Elevator Pitch
I want to see reports on the various songwriters and their musical catalog for my music publishing company.  It's too time consuming to use excel every time I need information compiled.

## Project Requirements

1. Must be written using CRUD
2. Must Use the Command Line to run
3. Must have 2-3 interesting queries


## Feature List:

- User can enter in Songs, Writers and Publisher Info to database.
- User can update incorrect information if stored incorrectly.
- User can remove a Song, Writer or Publisher.
- User can query various reports on Songs, Writers & Publishers.


## Interesting Queries

- Queries a songwriter song catalog for information that is missing. (Info the writer still needs to submit to publisher)
- Queries songs that were written in a certain contract period and their songwriter portion percentage.
- Queries songs that a writer wrote with a particular co-writer.
- Queries Publisher info for a certain song.


## Data Sources

- A publishing company has provided their music catalog via .xlsx files. I will need to parse it to reformat fields and tables. Here is a link to an example of one of their songwriter's catalog worksheets [here](https://github.com/rawerner/Hip-Publisher/tree/master/data)
